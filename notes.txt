Many layers of authentication and security

1)Username and password
    but anyone working inside the company can see the plain text passwd in the database
    or if someone hack the database .passwords cant be stored in form of plain text

2)Encryption of passwd in database
    Scramble the passwd.
    By using an encryption key.

    but if someone gets the encryption string passwds can be decrypted using the same fn and encryption string

3) Environment Variables

    A file storing encryption keys and imp files
    .env (npm i dotenv)
    require this as early as possible

    add .env file to git ignore
